	
So we are going to make a face recognition API which will be hosted on AWS
beanstalk.

For that we are going to use the most basic Face recogniser(LBPH).
You can google it how to implement face recognition in python.

I have used Flask to implement it. As its easier to use, You can use Django also.

So what I have done is downloaded an image from Firebase storage. And provided the
name of the file using parameters in the URL.
